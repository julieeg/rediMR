## ====================================================================
##  Refining Diet loci for Mendelian Randomization (ReDi-MR)
## ====================================================================

This readme includes code for the "rediMR" pipeline, developed as a means to refine a set of loci identified from a diet GWAS to a subset that do not have statistial evidence of confounding (of gene-diet associations) by pre-specified confounders

## Datasets used:
* UK Biobank data


## Covariates considered
* lifestyle: Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity
* ses: Income, Education
* adiposity: BMI, Waist-to-hip
* diet: Diet principal components (derived from UKB ffq data)
