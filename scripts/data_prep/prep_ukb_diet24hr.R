## From Cole et al., Heritability:
#A detailed 24HR questionnaire in which a subset of participants answered over 200 questions 
#on specific foods and beverages consumed (with quantities) in the preceding 24-hour day. 
#The 24HR was implemented as a questionnaire for the final 70 K in-person baseline assessment
#center participants from 2009–2010 and emailed four times to 320 K participants who consented 
#to re-contact via email between February 2011 and April 2012. Approximately 200 K individuals 
#have at least one and up to five recorded 24HR questionnaires.

#Each questionnaire was filtered for credible estimates of total energy intake 
#[≥1,000 kJ (UKB field 100002) and ≤20 MJ for males and ≤18 MJ for females (UKB field 100026)],
#typical dietary intake (UKB fields 100020 and 20085), completion duration greater than or 
#equal to 5 min (UKB field 20082), and overall completion (UKB field 20081). Additionally, 
#the participant could not be pregnant within 1 year of taking the 24HR nor have a cancer 
#diagnosis within the previous year (UKB fields 3,140 and 40005). All 24HR questions were 
#converted into 1/0 for yes/no to consumption; each categorical response was coded similarly
#[e.g., UKB field 20086 for special diet was converted into six binary variables for each response
#(gluten-free, lactose-free, low calorie, vegetarian, vegan, and a combined vegetarian or vegan field)]. 
#24HR questions pertaining to quantity consumed were also included as continuous variables.

##  24HR data cleaning ##
#########################

## Used pre-calculated food group weights (g) by UKB, from 24-hour recalls, as described
# in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-021-02535-x (N=93 food groups)

## Data cleaning
# -restrict plausible total energy intakes (Cole: 1000 kj/day & <20,000kj [M] or <18000 kj [F])
# -restrict to typical_diet_yesterday
# -restrict to >= 5 min completion time
# -restrict to overall completion (yes)
